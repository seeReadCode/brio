Why have I been ogling these 19th century geological maps of Canada?  Well dear reader, the blame falls squarely on Colorado School of Mines's [Professor Christian Shorey](https://geology.mines.edu/project/shorey-christian/).

A sommelier-friend's passing suggestion set me on to [Shorey's lectures from his SYGN 101 / GEGN 101 Earth and Environmental Systems class](https://geology.mines.edu/sygn101-podcasts/) and now here I am researching the crisis of soil erosion and reciting the chemical composition of the Earth.

> I especially enjoyed the big story part of the lecture series. The breadth and depth was remarkable. It was a pleasure hearing Dr. Shorey speak. he had a nice tone pace, and perspectives, and occasional humor between the facts. I'd be curious to hear what Dr. Shorey has to say 10 years after the making of the series. And all the subject matter is still so relevant!

As Unfrobox17's review and many similar gushers attest on the podcast's [iTunes page](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/earth-environmental-science/id439365947), Shorey makes good work of this "big habitable dirt ball of ours".  He recorded the lectures solo to help his students get deeper into the content and figured smartly that they could be of intertest to listeners farther afield.

With helpful mnemonics  – the timescale of the universe scaled down to a single day – and memorable allusions – drillers destroying bits on heat-hardening [caliche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliche) when [famously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_Jessica_McClure) rescuing an 18 month-old girl at the bottom of a well – the lectures, despite their length, tease out your curiosity without miring you in jargon or detail.

Although you might shirk Shorey's advice to memorize your minerals and rocks, diagrams for [Bowen's Reaction Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen%27s_reaction_series) and [soil horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_horizon) not to mention photos of sub-glacial volcanoes will extend your interest.

Eventually you could sit down with [these](https://quizlet.com/70275283/colorado-school-of-mines-shorey-earth-test-1-flash-cards/) [flashcards](https://quizlet.com/206124880/gegn-101-exam-1-flash-cards/) from his more diligent students.  And if you are more pedagogically inclined but technically averse, you might enjoy his discussion below about how me made the podcast as well as [the videos for his Earth Exploration class](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/earth-explorations/id439366320):
